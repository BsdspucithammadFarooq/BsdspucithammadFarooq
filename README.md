THis is a repository that contains data about all the work I have done in my course Intro to data science.
Moreover, I am trying to learn how to connect git with your git hub and commit and puysh changes using git bash rather than just drag and dropping them on the repository.
Special thanks to sir Nadeem Majeed to force us to learn this platform and work in a team by creating multiple branches and merging them when needed.
What to expect in this repository:

1.python libraries used to clean data like numpy or pandas.

2.Data visulation libraries like seaborn or software like power bi.

3.Jyputer notebooks (Basic).

4.Some machine learning and deep learning libraries like tensorflow, Keras, Scikit Learn etc.

PS: I am just a normal person not a pro programmer, So expect the code to have bugs in it or may be not that efficient :)
